🌿💫 FINAL MASTER PROMPT — “LifeSync: Sync Your Life, Grow Every Day”

Build a visually beautiful, emotionally balanced, and interactive website called “LifeSync.”
This is a UHV project designed to help users achieve complete well-being — physically, mentally, and socially — through reflection, wellness tracking, and daily activities.
It should have a peaceful, nature-inspired design with a cute cat mascot that guides and encourages the user.

🏡 🌸 Design & Theme

Overall look: Decorative, calm, and uplifting, like a digital wellness garden.

Add trees, flowers, petals, leaves, and soft clouds as moving or floating animations.

Use a color palette of pink, blue, cyan, green, and their light & dark shades.

Include both Light and Dark themes:

🌞 Light theme → soft pastel background with floral visuals.

🌙 Dark theme → black/navy background with glowing pastel highlights for text & icons.

Typography: use a clean, rounded, calm font like Poppins, Nunito, or Quicksand.

Keep design attractive, modern, and peaceful but also visually rich with nature-inspired elements.

All dashboards should be aesthetic, colorful, and decorated yet minimal enough to keep focus.

🔐 Login & Onboarding

Black background for the login and registration pages — for clarity and visibility while entering details.

Inputs: name, email, password (stored securely).

After signing up → direct user to a Wellness Test Page (covering hydration, stress, focus, exercise, mood, diet).

The system then generates a personalized wellness score and profile for the user.

Store all data in database (Firebase / Supabase / MongoDB).

Admin dashboard tracks total users and test insights.

🐾 Mascot — Cat Companion

A cute animated cat sits on the screen corner, appearing throughout the site.

The cat greets, motivates, and reacts to the user’s data or mood.

Examples:

“Good morning, sunshine ☀️ Let’s make today peaceful.”

“Time to hydrate! 💧”

“You’re doing great — keep syncing your life 🐾”

The cat can wink, stretch, or purr when the user completes tasks or logs habits.
